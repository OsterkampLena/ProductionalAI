    "# Notebook 6: Neural Network Modeling of Spindle Current\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook 4, we modeled the **spindle current** (`ACT_CURRENT_S`) using a **Random Forest Regressor** to understand how process variables influence current consumption during milling.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will **develop a neural network model** to predict the spindle current using the same set of process features. The goal is to compare the performance of a **deep learning approach** with the previously used **Random Forest model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this exercise, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to design and train a **feedforward neural network** for regression tasks  \n",
    "- Learn how to **scale data** before training a neural network  \n",
    "- Apply **performance metrics** such as **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R²** to evaluate model performance  \n",
    "- Visualize **learning curves** and compare predicted vs. actual values  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Given Information and Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with:\n",
    "- -Training, Validation and Testing datasets: `df_Train`, `df_Val`, and `df_Test`  \n",
    "- A list of **features** and the **target variable**\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics to use:  \n",
    "  - `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)`  \n",
    "  - `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`  \n",
    "  - `R² Score`\n",
    "\n",
    ">### The **neural network architecture and hyperparameters** (number of layers, units, dropout, learning rate, etc.) are **not provided**. You must **tune and select** them yourself through experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Import Libraries and Set Up Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Data Verification\n",
    "Before modeling, ensure that **no overlap** exists between training and test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Define Features and Target\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training a neural network, the input features must be **standardized** to have zero mean and unit variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Model Design and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines:\n",
    "- Use **Dense layers** with `ReLU` activations  \n",
    "- Include **Dropout layers** for regularization  \n",
    "- Experiment with different **numbers of layers** and **units per layer**  \n",
    "- Compile the model using:\n",
    "  - **Loss:** Mean Squared Error (`'mse'`)  \n",
    "  - **Metric:** Mean Absolute Error (`'mae'`)  \n",
    "  - **Optimizer:** `Adam` with a learning rate you choose  \n",
    "- Implement **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting (monitor `'val_loss'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, evaluate your model using the following metrics:\n",
    "- `R² Score`\n",
    "- `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)`\n",
    "- `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the results against the **Random Forest model** from the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the following visualizations to interpret model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Curves** – plot training vs. validation loss  \n",
    "   *(Hint: use `history.history['loss']` and `history.history['val_loss']`)*  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictions vs. Actual Values** – compare predicted spindle current with true values  \n",
    "   *(Hint: `plt.plot(y_test, label='Actual')` vs. `plt.plot(y_pred, label='Predicted')`)*"
